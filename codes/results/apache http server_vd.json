As a result, this function can be bypassed and leads to an Open Redirect vulnerability in the logout functionality.

Initial assessment shows that this bug does not appear to allow gaining arbitrary code execution, but can reliably provoke a denial of service by repeatedly crashing the Apache workers. This bug has been corrected in version 2.4.9 by performing argument interpolation only once, using the `hiredis` API. As a workaround, this vulnerability can be mitigated by setting `OIDCCacheEncrypt` to `on`, as cache keys are cryptographically hashed before use when this option is enabled."

At worst, if DEP is enabled for the Apache process, you could cause \\\\r\\\n * a constant DoS by looping this (since apache will automatically restart) :)\\\\r\\\n *\\\\r\\\n * Note that the exploit code may need to be run multiple times before a shell is spawned (70%\\\\r\\\n * success rate - tested on three different systems). Furthermore, the exploit code may require \\\\r\\\n * modification to exploit this vulnerability on different platforms. This is due to loaded memory \\\\r\\\n * references to the unloaded DLL (they will be different for each ISAPI module). Do not test\\\\r\\\n * this code in a VM otherwise the code may fail to send the RESET packet (something to do with\\\\r\\\n * VMware gracefully closing the connection, instead of sending a RESET packet) - I didnt want\\\\r\\\n * to have to use raw packets on Windows. \\\\r\\\n *\\\\r\\\n * Shellcode Note: \\\\r\\\n * The shellcode writes \"pwn-isapi\" to \"sos.txt\" which is created in the current working directory. \\\\r\\\n * Most operating systems should be supported by this shellcode. I\\\\\\'ve used Skylined\\\\\\'s method of finding\\\\r\\\n * the base address of kernel32.dll for Windows 7 and modified it so that it will find the base \\\\r\\\n * address of msvcrt.dll instead.

Reportedly, a buffer overrun and signal race condition occur. Exploiting these conditions may allow arbitrary code to run.\\\\r\\\n \\\\r\\\n**Update**: Reportedly, at least one worm is exploiting this vulnerability to propagate in the wild. The worm targets FreeBSD 4.5 systems running Apache 1.3.22-24 and 1.3.20.

Both MySQL and PostgreSQL database\\\\r\\\ntypes are supported. It supports arbitrary database designs as traffic\\\\r\\\nrecording is performed via a user defined query in the Apache configuration\\\\r\\\nusing placeholders for received values.

                "content": "\"b'Source: http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2011/ApacheModSetEnvIfIntegerOverflow/\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\n## Background\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\nThe Apache HTTP Server is an open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems including UNIX, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS/X and Netware. The goal of this project is to provide a secure, efficient and extensible server that provides HTTP services observing the current HTTP standards. Apache has been the most popular web server on the Internet since April of 1996.\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\n## Problem Description\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\nDuring routine testing, an integer overflow was found in apache2-mpm-worker 2.2.19 in the function ap_pregsub called from mod-setenvif. The issue affects all versions from 2.0.x to 2.0.64 and 2.2.x to 2.2.21, not depending on the mode of operation (worker, prefork, ..). When a header field is mangled using SetEnvIf, the new environment variable data can be multiples of the size of the submitted header field. When ap_pregsub from server/util.c calculates the buffer size using\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\n        else if (no < nmatch && pmatch[no].rm_so < pmatch[no].rm_eo) {\\\\r\\\n            len += pmatch[no].rm_eo - pmatch[no].rm_so;\\\\r\\\n        }\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\nthe length value overflows and is used in a subsequent allocation call of buffer too small:\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\n    dest = dst = apr_pcalloc(p, len + 1);\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\nThe subsequent filling of the buffer with user-supplied data leads to buffer overflow. Even without overflowing, the allocation of significant amounts of server memory for excessivly large environment variables should be considered a problem also.\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\n## Impact\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\nDepending on the input data, exploitation of this issue leads to:\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\n- allocation of large quantities of server memory, killing processes due to out-of-memory conditions or reducing system performance to crawl due to massive swapping.\\\\r\\\n- invalid memory access when copying more than 4GB of data into the much smaller buffer. Since the loop copying the data uses only stack and libc-heap, not the apr pool, for source and destination addresses, copy process is linear, starting at low address and pool is separated by unaccessible memory pages for protection on linux. Usually this will only cause termination of the apache process, which is restarted automatically. The impact is increased system load and DOS-condition while under attack.\\\\r\\\n- At least with multi-threaded server (worker), arbitrary code execution is proven, on single-threaded varians, the use of crafted stop-sequences might allow code execution even on these systems. On many systems ASLR will reduce the efficiency of the attack, but even with ASLR enabled, the automatic restart of processes allows to probe for all possible mappings of libc. An attacker, that has already access to another account on the machen, might be able to use ApacheNoFollowSymlinkTimerace to learn the memory map of the process, thus having the posibility to reach nearly 100% efficiency.\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\nTo trigger this issue, mod_setenvif must be enabled and the attacker has to be able to place a crafted .htaccess file on the server. Since the triggering of the exploit might depend on a magic header field, the malicious .htaccess might be placed as backdoor in web-content .zip files or could be stored dormant on the server until activation by the corresponding magic request.\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\nSource: http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2011/ApacheModSetEnvIfIntegerOverflow/DemoExploit.html\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\n## Starting Point\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\nDuring routine testing, an integer overflow in apache2-mpm-worker 2.2.19 mod-setenvif was found. The crash occured when mangling request headers using a crafted .htaccess-file (http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2011/ApacheModSetEnvIfIntegerOverflow/SingleThread-htaccess). The broken code was ap_pregsub in server/util.c, where the buffer size of a new header field could overflow, the value was then used for memory allocation. When copying data to the buffer an, overwrite of the an apr (apache portable runtime) memory-pool boundaries occured, similar to standard heap buffer overflows.\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\n## Outline of Exploit\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\nThe main goals creating the exploit were:\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\n- Exploit has to be triggerable via HTTP GET requests only\\\\r\\\n- Exploit data has to be 0-byte free to have valid HTTP-protocol\\\\r\\\n- No alternative way of heap-spraying is used, e.g. GET + content-length. All variants I knew of had much too low efficiency\\\\r\\\n- Use libc for ROP, although all libc-addresses start with 0-byte, which cannot be sent via HTTP\\\\r\\\n- Rely only on libc address guess, but not heap/stack address guess, unless guess could be made nearly 100% reliable\\\\r\\\n- Use the already open HTTP-connections and turn them into command connections on the fly\\\\r\\\n- Have exploit in less than 256 bytes\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\nTwo different exploit layouts were developed. The first one used multiple threads, so that one was overwriting the data of the second thread before hitting the end of the memory area. Precise timing was essential to get shell access.\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\nThe second one used a more crafted substitution expression, stopping the copy in a single thread by modifying the regular expression currently processed in the thread. Since there is race condition involved, this exploit was far more reliable than the first one.'\""

A child running with lower privileges than the parent process might trigger an invalid free in the privileged parent process during parent shutdown by modifying data on the shared memory segment.\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\n## Method\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\nA child process can trigger the bug by changing the value of ap_scoreboard_e sb_type, which resides in the global_score structure on the shared memory segment. The value is usually 2 (SB_SHARED):\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\ntypedef struct {\\\\r\\\n    int             server_limit;\\\\r\\\n    int             thread_limit;\\\\r\\\n    ap_scoreboard_e sb_type;\\\\r\\\n    ap_generation_t running_generation; /* the generation of children which\\\\r\\\n                                         * should still be serving requests.\\\\r\\\n                                         */\\\\r\\\n    apr_time_t restart_time;\\\\r\\\n    int             lb_limit;\\\\r\\\n} global_score;\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\nWhen changing the scoreboard type of a shared memory segment to something else, the root process will try to release the shared memory using free during normal shutdown. Since the memory was allocated using mmap, not malloc, the call to free from ap_cleanup_scoreboard (server/scoreboard.c) triggers abort within libc.\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\napr_status_t ap_cleanup_scoreboard(void *d)\\\\r\\\n{\\\\r\\\n    if (ap_scoreboard_image == NULL) {\\\\r\\\n        return APR_SUCCESS;\\\\r\\\n    }\\\\r\\\n    if (ap_scoreboard_image->global->sb_type == SB_SHARED) {\\\\r\\\n        ap_cleanup_shared_mem(NULL);\\\\r\\\n    }\\\\r\\\n    else {\\\\r\\\n        free(ap_scoreboard_image->global);\\\\r\\\n        free(ap_scoreboard_image);\\\\r\\\n        ap_scoreboard_image = NULL;\\\\r\\\n    }\\\\r\\\n    return APR_SUCCESS;\\\\r\\\n}\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\nAbort output is written to apache default error log:\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\n[Fri Dec 30 10:19:57 2011] [notice] caught SIGTERM, shutting down\\\\r\\\n*** glibc detected *** /usr/sbin/apache2: free(): invalid pointer: 0xb76f4008 ***\\\\r\\\n======= Backtrace: =========\\\\r\\\n/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6(+0x6ebc2)[0x17ebc2]\\\\r\\\n/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6(+0x6f862)[0x17f862]\\\\r\\\n/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6(cfree+0x6d)[0x18294d]\\\\r\\\n/usr/sbin/apache2(ap_cleanup_scoreboard+0x29)[0xa57519]\\\\r\\\n/usr/lib/libapr-1.so.0(+0x19846)[0x545846]\\\\r\\\n/usr/lib/libapr-1.so.0(apr_pool_destroy+0x52)[0x5449ec]\\\\r\\\n/usr/sbin/apache2(+0x1f063)[0xa52063]\\\\r\\\n/usr/sbin/apache2(main+0xeea)[0xa51e3a]\\\\r\\\n/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6(__libc_start_main+0xf3)[0x129113]\\\\r\\\n/usr/sbin/apache2(+0x1ef3d)[0xa51f3d]\\\\r\\\n======= Memory map: ========\\\\r\\\n00110000-00286000 r-xp 00000000 08:01 132367\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\nTo reproduce, attach to a www-data (non-root) child process and increment the value at offset 0x10 in the shared memory segment.

The ap_pmemdup looks as follows:\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\n       112APR_DECLARE(void *) apr_pmemdup(apr_pool_t *a, const void\\\\r\\\n*m, apr_size_t n)\\\\r\\\n       113{\\\\r\\\n       114    void *res;\\\\r\\\n       115\\\\r\\\n       116    if (m == NULL)\\\\r\\\n       117      return NULL;\\\\r\\\n       118    res = apr_palloc(a, n);\\\\r\\\n       119    memcpy(res, m, n);\\\\r\\\n       120    return res;\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\n       It allocates memory using apr_palloc function which returns\\\\r\\\n\"ditry\" memory (note that apr_pcalloc overwrite\\\\r\\\n       allocated memory with NULs).\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\n       So it\\\\\\'s non-deterministic what\\\\\\'s after the copied \"G\" byte.\\\\r\\\nThere might be  or might be not. For now let\\\\\\'s\\\\r\\\n       assume that the memory allocated by apr_palloc was dirty\\\\r\\\n(containing random bytes).\\\\r\\\n    7) ap_escape_logitem returns \"G.....\" .junk. \"\"\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\nThe value from the example above is then pushed to the ap_escape_html2\\\\r\\\nfunction which is also declared in util.c:\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\n    1860AP_DECLARE(char *) ap_escape_html2(apr_pool_t *p, const char\\\\r\\\n*s, int toasc)\\\\r\\\n    1861{\\\\r\\\n    1862    int i, j;\\\\r\\\n    1863    char *x;\\\\r\\\n    1864\\\\r\\\n    1865    /* first, count the number of extra characters */\\\\r\\\n    1866    for (i = 0, j = 0; s[i] != \\\\\\'\\\\\\'; i++)\\\\r\\\n    1867        if (s[i] == \\\\\\'\\\\\\')\\\\r\\\n    1868            j += 3;\\\\r\\\n    1869        else if (s[i] == \\\\\\'&\\\\\\')\\\\r\\\n    1870            j += 4;\\\\r\\\n    1871        else if (s[i] == \\\\\\'\"\\\\\\')\\\\r\\\n    1872            j += 5;\\\\r\\\n    1873        else if (toasc && !apr_isascii(s[i]))\\\\r\\\n    1874            j += 5;\\\\r\\\n    1875\\\\r\\\n    1876    if (j == 0)\\\\r\\\n    1877        return apr_pstrmemdup(p, s, i);\\\\r\\\n    1878\\\\r\\\n    1879    x = apr_palloc(p, i + j + 1);\\\\r\\\n    1880    for (i = 0, j = 0; s[i] != \\\\\\'\\\\\\'; i++, j++)\\\\r\\\n    1881        if (s[i] == \\\\\\'\\\\\\') {\\\\r\\\n    1886            memcpy(&x[j], \">\", 4);\\\\r\\\n    1887            j += 3;\\\\r\\\n    1888        }\\\\r\\\n    1889        else if (s[i] == \\\\\\'&\\\\\\') {\\\\r\\\n    1890            memcpy(&x[j], \"&\", 5);\\\\r\\\n    1891            j += 4;\\\\r\\\n    1892        }\\\\r\\\n    1893        else if (s[i] == \\\\\\'\"\\\\\\') {\\\\r\\\n    1894            memcpy(&x[j], \"\"\", 6);\\\\r\\\n    1895            j += 5;\\\\r\\\n    1896        }\\\\r\\\n    1897        else if (toasc && !apr_isascii(s[i])) {\\\\r\\\n    1898            char *esc = apr_psprintf(p, \"&#%3.3d;\", (unsigned\\\\r\\\nchar)s[i]);\\\\r\\\n    1899            memcpy(&x[j], esc, 6);\\\\r\\\n    1900            j += 5;\\\\r\\\n    1901        }\\\\r\\\n    1902        else\\\\r\\\n    1903            x[j] = s[i];\\\\r\\\n    1904\\\\r\\\n    1905    x[j] = \\\\\\'\\\\\\';\\\\r\\\n    1906    return x;\\\\r\\\n    1907}\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\nIf the string from the example above would be passed to this function\\\\r\\\nwe should get the following code-flow:\\\\r\\\n\\\\r\\\n    1) in the for-loop started in line 1866 we count the length of\\\\r\\\nescaped string\\\\r\\\n    2) because \\\\\\'s\\\\\\' string contains junk (due to only one byte being\\\\r\\\nallocated by the apr_palloc function),\\\\r\\\n       it may contain \\\\\\'>\\\\\\' character.
