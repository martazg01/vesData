# vesData 

This tool takes a user-specified IoT product name (e.g., "Amazon Echo") as input, extracts relevant cyber risk data from chosen public repositories using its web crawler and scraper modules. The tool compiles this information into a JSON-formatted text file (illustrated below) as output.

Our proof-of-concept implementation of vesData leverages the most widely-used repository in each of the three categories (CVE for vulnerability, Exploit-DB for exploit, and NVD for solution). Scaling up the proof-of-concept is deferred to future work.
